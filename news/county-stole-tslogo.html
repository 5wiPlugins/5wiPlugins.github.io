<h1 style="text-align: center;">A county website "stole" our Timesheet logo</h1>
<p>A motherfucking county (you read that right) stole our timesheet logo.&nbsp;Even, lemme tell ya, i didn't design that Timesheet logo! It was desinged by an unknown OpenIntents staff member. The picture below will show the proof:</p>

<p>See that? Do you belive me? if you dont, look at the URL: <a href="http://esuite.sebastiancountyar.gov">http://esuite.sebastiancountyar.gov</a>. It's a real county because .GOV is only used for goverment &amp; administrative uses.</p>
<p>Edit: I am probably talking about the wrong definition of county (nope you are talking about the right definition lol) because i think this county comes from Argentina. Tell me if im wrong by tweeting me @ <span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">http://twitter.com/AdrinJoseRivera</span></span>.</p>
<p>Edit 2: They are located in Arkansas. What was that thing you read at the top?</p>
<p>Edit 3: Did you like that?</p></body>
