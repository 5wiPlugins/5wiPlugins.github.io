<h1>New Voice Extension Coming Soon (and a to-do list)</h1>
<p>Hello. We are planning the release of a Voice Notes extension for our Notepad app. Alongside it (the extension), we will launch a To-do list.</p>
<p>Probably you already know what a To-do list is. Well, did you know that they can also dobule as shopping lists? If you didnt know, You didnt have a G1 back in '09 or have never heard of to-do lists.</p>
<p>We will launch the mentioned applications at maybe 5 PM. Probably soon.</p>
<p>Edit: Late but ok idc.</p></body>
